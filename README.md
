# Automated Agent for Block / Pixel Party (Minecraft)

This project explores automated agent behavior in a real-time, event-driven game environment using Minecraft as a sandbox.  
The agent detects a dynamically changing target state and navigates the player toward it under strict timing constraints.

This is a **proof-of-concept** focused on systems design and decision-making, not a competitive gameplay tool.

## Motivation

I built this project to learn and experiment with:
- Event-driven logic in a live environment
- Real-time decision-making under latency and tick constraints
- Translating abstract game state into concrete movement actions
- Debugging automation in noisy, unpredictable conditions

Minecraft minigames provide a constrained but non-trivial environment for testing these ideas.

## How It Works (High Level)

The agent follows a simple control loop:

1. **Sense**  
   Reads the relevant game state (e.g. target block / color for the current round).

2. **Decide**  
   Determines the optimal movement direction based on the detected target and current player position.

3. **Act**  
   Issues movement inputs to guide the player toward the correct block.

4. **Correct**  
   Continuously re-evaluates state to adjust for timing changes, latency, or incorrect assumptions.

This loop repeats every tick, allowing the agent to react in real time rather than relying on precomputed paths.

## Testing Environment

- Tested primarily on **private servers**
- Also tested on a **public server with explicit staff permission**
- Not designed or intended for use on public competitive servers without consent

## Ethics & Scope

This project is intended for **educational and experimental purposes only**.
It is not meant to be deployed in environments where automation violates fair play or community rules.

The goal is to study autonomous behavior in interactive systems, not to gain unfair advantages.

## Future Improvements

- Better target detection robustness
- Smarter correction logic under high latency
- Cleaner abstraction between sensing, decision, and control layers
- Support for additional game modes or environments
